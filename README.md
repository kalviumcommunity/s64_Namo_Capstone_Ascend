### Capstone Project: Fitness Tracker App

Project Idea Brief
The Fitness Tracker App is a full-stack web application that helps users track their workouts, nutrition, and progress over time. It includes features such as personalized workout plans, goal setting, progress visualization, and AI-powered workout recommendations. The application will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and will be deployed for public use.
